Python Challenge
This contains two modules - one for banking analysis, one for polling analysis.

Banking analysis (PyBank) reads a series of transactions and outputs KPIs to both the Python console,
	and a text file under analysis.
Resources should contain a list of monthly transactions as budget_data.csv in Resources, 
	with a header, following the format in the sample file.

Polling analysis (PyPoll) reads a set of voting data and outputs KPIs to both the Python console,
	and a text file under analysis.
Resources should contain a list of votes as election_data.csv in Resources, 
	with a header, following the format in the sample file.
